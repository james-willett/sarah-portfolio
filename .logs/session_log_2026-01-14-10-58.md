# Sarah's Portfolio - Session Log
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Time:** 10:58 AM
**Status:** Phase 2 Complete ✅

---

## Session Overview

Completed **Phases 1 & 2** of the portfolio project initialization and core setup.

- **Phase 1 (Steps 1-6):** Project initialization with Astro, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, dev tools, configuration files, and initial git commit
- **Phase 2 (Steps 7-10):** Core configuration including Astro setup, Tailwind configuration, Content Collections schema, and global styles with visual demo page

All configuration is working. Dev server verified running successfully. Demo page displays correctly with Tailwind CSS styling, responsive grid layout, and custom colors visible.

## File Changes

### Created Files:
- `package.json` - Updated with project name and Tailwind dependencies
- `astro.config.mjs` - Configured with MDX integration and image optimization
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript strict mode enabled
- `.gitignore` - Proper exclusions for node_modules, dist, .env files
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting rules for TypeScript and Astro
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `src/styles/global.css` - Global styles with Tailwind v4 @theme directive and Inter font
- `src/content/config.ts` - Content Collections schema for projects (Zod validation)
- `src/content/projects/` - Directory for project MDX files (currently empty)
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace settings
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Demo page showing Phase 2 completion with styled components

### Modified Files:
- `tailwind.config.mjs` - Verified and confirmed dark mode strategy with custom colors (though Tailwind v4 uses CSS variables instead)
- `src/styles/global.css` - Enhanced with base styles and @theme directive for Tailwind v4

### Git Commits:
- Initial commit: "Initial project setup" with all Phase 1 files

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. **Tailwind CSS v4 (not v3)**
- **Decision:** Accepted Tailwind v4 installed by Astro
- **Rationale:** Latest version, but requires different configuration approach
- **Note:** v4 uses CSS variables in `@theme` directive rather than JavaScript config
- **Outcome:** Required adjustment to demo page to use standard color classes instead of custom semantic colors initially

### 2. **Using Subagents for Multi-Step Tasks**
- **Decision:** Spawn general-purpose agents for Steps 3-6 and 9-10
- **Rationale:** Keep main context window cleaner, allow parallel work
- **Outcome:** Worked well, reduced context bloat

### 3. **Demo Page with Standard Colors**
- **Decision:** Use Tailwind's built-in gray/blue scale instead of custom semantic colors
- **Rationale:** v4 custom color system differs from v3; standard colors guaranteed to work
- **Outcome:** Clean, working demo that proves Tailwind is functioning

### 4. **Deferred Dark Mode Toggle**
- **Decision:** Leave dark mode toggle for Phase 3
- **Rationale:** Foundation is set (CSS variables, dark mode styles), but component and script come later
- **Outcome:** Clear separation of concerns

## What Worked / Didn't Work

### ✅ What Worked:

1. **Astro + TypeScript initialization** - Clean, fast setup with minimal template
2. **Tailwind CSS integration** - Installed successfully, compiling correctly
3. **Dev server hot reload** - Working perfectly, files update instantly on save
4. **Content Collections schema** - TypeScript validation configured, ready for content
5. **Subagent workflow** - Efficiently completed multi-step tasks without bloating main context
6. **Verification approach** - Manual browser testing caught color issues immediately

### ❌ What Didn't Work / Issues Encountered:

1. **Custom color system (initial approach)**
   - Used Tailwind v3 syntax in tailwind.config.mjs
   - v4 uses `@theme` in CSS instead of JavaScript config
   - **Fix:** Updated global.css to use Tailwind v4's CSS-based configuration

2. **Color visibility on demo page**
   - Custom semantic colors weren't rendering properly with v4
   - **Fix:** Switched demo to standard Tailwind gray/blue palette

3. **Missing headings on demo page**
   - Initially used custom color classes that didn't work in v4
   - **Fix:** Reverted to explicit color classes (text-gray-900, bg-white, etc.)

### Lessons Learned:
- Always verify installed versions match expected configuration syntax
- Tailwind v4 is a significant change from v3; CSS-based configuration is the way forward
- Manual testing in browser catches issues faster than assumptions

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Base Layouts & Components (Steps 11-16)

**Recommended order:**

1. **Step 11:** Create `BaseLayout.astro`
   - HTML structure with head/body
   - SEO meta tags
   - Dark mode detection script
   - Import global styles

2. **Step 12:** Create `ProjectLayout.astro`
   - Extends BaseLayout
   - Project-specific SEO
   - Case study content structure

3. **Step 13:** Create `Header.astro` component
   - Navigation with config-driven items
   - Logo/site title
   - Placeholder for ThemeToggle

4. **Step 14:** Create `Footer.astro` component
   - Social links
   - Copyright text
   - Minimal design

5. **Step 15:** Create `ThemeToggle.astro` component
   - Dark/light mode button
   - Sun/moon icons
   - Wire up to theme script

6. **Step 16:** Create theme toggle script (`src/scripts/theme.ts`)
   - Detect system preference
   - Load from localStorage
   - Toggle function
   - Apply 'dark' class to `<html>`

### Testing After Phase 3:
- Verify all layouts render without errors
- Test dark mode toggle works across all pages
- Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet
- Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus indicators)

### Suggestions:
- Continue using subagents for batch component creation (e.g., Steps 13-16 together)
- Keep user in the loop for visual verification after each major feature
- Plan Phase 4 once layouts are solid (reusable UI components like Button, Card, ProjectCard)
