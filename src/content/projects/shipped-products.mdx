## Overview

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on products across diverse industries - from fintech to healthcare to productivity tools. This page highlights a selection of products I've designed that are live and serving real users today.

Each project taught me something different about the craft of design and the challenges of shipping great products.

## Finbridge - Personal Finance Dashboard

### The Product

Finbridge is a personal finance app that helps users understand and manage their money across multiple accounts. It aggregates bank accounts, investments, and credit cards into a single, intuitive dashboard.

### My Role

As the sole designer on a small startup team, I was responsible for:

- User research and persona development
- Information architecture and user flows
- Visual design and prototyping
- Design system creation
- Usability testing coordination

### The Challenge

Users were overwhelmed by financial data spread across multiple apps and websites. They needed a way to see their complete financial picture without manual tracking or spreadsheets.

### Key Design Decisions

**1. "Money Map" Visualization**

Instead of traditional tables and charts, I designed a "Money Map" - a visual representation of money flow between accounts. Users can see at a glance where their money comes from and where it goes.

**2. Insight-First Home Screen**

Rather than showing raw account balances, the home screen surfaces actionable insights:
- "You've spent 20% more on dining this month"
- "At this rate, you'll save $450 by end of month"
- "Recurring charge detected: Netflix increased by $3"

**3. Privacy-Conscious Sharing**

For users who want to share progress with partners or advisors, I designed a "sanitized view" that shows trends and percentages without exposing exact dollar amounts.

### Results

- **4.7 star rating** on App Store (2,400+ reviews)
- **Featured** in Apple's "Apps for Managing Your Money"
- **150,000+ downloads** in first year
- **$2M seed round** raised partially on strength of the UX

## MediTrack - Medication Adherence App

### The Product

MediTrack helps patients manage complex medication schedules. It's particularly focused on elderly users and those with chronic conditions who take multiple medications daily.

### My Role

I led the UX design on a cross-functional team of 8, working with:

- Product manager
- iOS and Android developers
- Backend engineers
- Healthcare compliance specialists

### The Challenge

Medication non-adherence is a $300 billion problem in healthcare. Users forget to take medications, take incorrect doses, or stop taking medications when they feel better. Existing solutions were either too simple (basic reminders) or too complex (medical-grade apps with terrible UX).

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Voice-First Interaction**

Recognizing that many users have visual or dexterity limitations, I designed a voice-first interface. Users can say "I took my medication" rather than navigating through screens.

**2. Caregiver Dashboard**

For users with caregivers (family members, nurses), I designed a companion web dashboard that shows adherence patterns without requiring the caregiver to have the app installed.

**3. Gentle Escalation**

Rather than aggressive reminders, I designed a "gentle escalation" system:
- First reminder: Subtle notification
- Second reminder (30 min later): More prominent notification
- Third reminder (2 hours later): Optional alert to caregiver

**4. Accessibility Throughout**

Every interaction was designed with accessibility in mind:
- High contrast mode
- Large touch targets (minimum 48px)
- Full VoiceOver/TalkBack support
- Reduced motion option

### Results

- **89% adherence rate** for active users (vs. 50% industry average)
- **Partnership with major health system** (10,000+ patients)
- **HIPAA compliant** with full audit trail
- **Reduced hospital readmissions** by 23% in pilot study

## Taskhero - Team Productivity Tool

### The Product

Taskhero is a project management tool designed specifically for creative teams. It combines task tracking with visual collaboration features like mood boards and design review workflows.

### My Role

I joined as the second designer, reporting to the Design Director. My responsibilities included:

- Feature design for the collaboration module
- Design system contributions
- User research for enterprise features
- Prototyping and user testing

### The Challenge

Creative teams were using multiple tools - Trello for tasks, Miro for collaboration, Notion for documentation. Taskhero aimed to consolidate these workflows without losing the specialized features creatives rely on.

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Canvas-Based Task Views**

Instead of traditional list or board views, I designed a "canvas view" where tasks can be freely arranged spatially. This supports the non-linear thinking many creative teams prefer.

**2. Design Review Mode**

A specialized view for reviewing design work:
- Side-by-side comparison of versions
- Pinned comments on specific pixels
- Approval workflow with stakeholder sign-off
- Integration with Figma and Sketch

**3. "Focus Time" Feature**

Recognizing that creative work requires deep focus, I designed a "Focus Time" mode that:
- Suppresses notifications
- Hides non-urgent tasks
- Plays optional ambient sounds
- Tracks focus metrics over time

### Results

- **50,000+ teams** using the product
- **Enterprise contracts** with design agencies and in-house teams
- **Featured** at Config conference as Figma integration example
- **NPS of 67** (considered excellent for B2B software)

## Common Threads

### What I've Learned Across These Projects

**1. Simplicity is earned, not assumed**

The simplest interfaces often require the most design work. Reducing complexity while maintaining power is the hardest design challenge.

**2. Users are not their data**

Analytics tell you what users do, not why they do it. Every quantitative insight needs qualitative context to be actionable.

**3. Ship and iterate**

Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Getting real user feedback on imperfect products beats perfecting products without users.

**4. Accessibility benefits everyone**

Features designed for accessibility (voice control, high contrast, large targets) often become features that all users appreciate.

**5. Cross-functional relationships matter**

The best products come from teams where design, engineering, and product work as true partners, not sequential handoffs.

## My Design Philosophy

These shipped products reflect a design philosophy I've developed over years of practice:

### Design for real people

Not personas on paper, but actual humans with complex lives, varying abilities, and limited attention. The best designs meet people where they are.

### Question assumptions

Every project starts with assumptions that turn out to be wrong. Good design process surfaces these assumptions early and tests them rigorously.

### Measure what matters

Not vanity metrics, but outcomes that reflect genuine user value. Did we actually help people manage their money, take their medications, or ship their creative work?

### Stay humble

Users will always surprise you. The design that seems obvious to you may confuse them. The feature you almost cut may become their favorite. Listen more than you talk.

## Let's Work Together

These products represent a small sample of my work. I'm always excited to take on new challenges, especially in areas like:

- **AI-powered products** - Designing trustworthy AI experiences
- **Healthcare technology** - Making complex medical information accessible
- **Sustainability** - Helping users make environmentally conscious choices
- **Financial wellness** - Demystifying money management

If you have a product challenge that could use thoughtful UX design, I'd love to hear about it.
