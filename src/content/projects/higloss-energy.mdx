## Overview

HiGloss approached me with a challenge: their energy monitoring app had all the data users needed, but engagement was low. Users weren't connecting their daily behaviors to their energy consumption, resulting in missed opportunities for savings and sustainability.

My role was to transform complex energy data into an intuitive, actionable experience that would help users understand and reduce their consumption.

## The Challenge

### Business Problem

HiGloss's existing app displayed raw energy data in tables and basic charts. While technically accurate, the information was difficult for average users to interpret:

- **Low engagement**: Only 12% of users checked the app weekly
- **Poor comprehension**: User research showed 67% couldn't explain their energy patterns
- **Missed opportunities**: Users weren't making behavioral changes despite having data access

### User Needs

Through initial discovery sessions, I identified three core user needs:

1. **Understanding** - "What does my energy usage actually mean?"
2. **Comparison** - "How do I compare to similar households?"
3. **Action** - "What specific changes can I make today?"

---

## Research & Discovery

### Methodology

I conducted a mixed-methods research approach over three weeks:

- **8 user interviews** with existing app users
- **Contextual inquiry** observing 4 households interact with their energy data
- **Competitive analysis** of 6 similar energy apps
- **Analytics review** of current app usage patterns

### Key Insights

The research revealed several critical insights that shaped the design direction:

**Insight 1: Numbers without context are meaningless**
> "I see I used 847 kWh last month, but I have no idea if that's good or bad." - Research participant

**Insight 2: Users think in activities, not units**
> "I don't care about kilowatt hours. Tell me how many loads of laundry I can run." - Research participant

**Insight 3: Gamification drives behavior change**
When shown competitor apps with goals and progress indicators, users expressed strong interest in "beating" their previous performance.

## The Solution

### Design Principles

Based on the research, I established three design principles:

1. **Context over raw data** - Always show comparisons and benchmarks
2. **Activity-based framing** - Translate energy into relatable activities
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Surface key insights first, details on demand

### Key Features

#### 1. Energy Score Dashboard

Replaced the data-heavy home screen with an intuitive "Energy Score" - a single number (0-100) that summarizes monthly performance. Color-coded feedback provides immediate understanding without reading charts.

#### 2. Activity Translator

A new feature that converts energy consumption into relatable equivalents:
- "This month's usage could power 142 hours of streaming"
- "Your heating used as much energy as driving 340 miles"

#### 3. Neighborhood Comparison

Anonymous benchmarking against similar households in the area, with privacy-respecting comparisons that motivate without shaming.

#### 4. Smart Goals

AI-powered goal suggestions based on usage patterns, with achievable weekly targets that build momentum toward larger savings.

## Design Process

### Information Architecture

I restructured the app around three primary user flows:

1. **Check-in** (daily) - Quick glance at Energy Score and any alerts
2. **Explore** (weekly) - Understand patterns and compare to benchmarks
3. **Optimize** (monthly) - Set goals and track progress

### Visual Design

The visual language needed to feel:

- **Approachable** - Not intimidating or overly technical
- **Trustworthy** - Accurate data presentation
- **Motivating** - Encouraging positive change

I developed a gradient-based color system that transitions from warm (high usage) to cool (efficient) colors, creating an intuitive visual language without relying on red/green which can be problematic for colorblind users.

### Prototyping & Testing

I created high-fidelity prototypes in Figma and conducted three rounds of usability testing:

- **Round 1**: Validated the Energy Score concept and activity translations
- **Round 2**: Refined the goal-setting flow based on confusion points
- **Round 3**: Final validation with 95% task completion rate

---

## Outcome

### Quantitative Results

Three months after launch, the redesigned app showed significant improvements:

- **Engagement up 340%** - Weekly active users increased from 12% to 53%
- **Comprehension improved** - 89% of users could explain their energy patterns (up from 33%)
- **Behavioral change** - Users reduced consumption by an average of 12%

### Qualitative Feedback

> "I actually look forward to checking my Energy Score now. It's like a game I want to win." - App Store review

> "Finally, an energy app that speaks human, not engineer." - User feedback survey

### Recognition

The redesigned HiGloss app was featured in:

- Apple App Store "Apps We Love" (March 2024)
- Nominated for a UX Design Award in the Sustainability category

## Reflection

### What Worked Well

- **Early research investment** - The three weeks of discovery paid off enormously in design confidence
- **Iterative testing** - Each round of testing revealed issues we wouldn't have caught otherwise
- **Cross-functional collaboration** - Working closely with data science ensured the activity translations were accurate

### What I'd Do Differently

- **Earlier stakeholder alignment** - Some features were descoped late due to technical constraints I should have identified earlier
- **More diverse testing participants** - Our testing skewed toward tech-savvy users; broader testing would have surfaced additional accessibility needs

---

## Next Steps

Based on user feedback, HiGloss is planning several enhancements:

- **Smart home integration** - Automatic device-level breakdown
- **Social features** - Opt-in challenges with friends and family
- **Carbon footprint tracking** - Expanding beyond energy to full environmental impact

I continue to advise on these features as they move through the design process.
