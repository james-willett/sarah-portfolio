# Session Log - 2026-01-16 (17:26)

## Session Overview

Successfully completed a comprehensive font migration and homepage design implementation. Replaced placeholder Space Grotesk font with the real PP Radio Grotesk font family (Light, Regular, Bold, Black weights). Fixed homepage layout to match design mockup with larger bento grid images, increased "Shipped Products" text size, and hidden dark mode toggle. Cleaned up all dark mode code from the codebase. Fixed navigation bar active state styling to show white text on dark background. All fonts are now loading correctly via local .woff2/.woff files.

## File Changes

### Created
- `public/fonts/Radio Grotesk/` (directory with 8 font files)

- `src/components/Header.astro` - Removed ThemeToggle import and component. Hidden dark mode toggle on desktop with `md:hidden`. Added `!text-white` to active nav state to ensure white text on dark pill background.

- `tailwind.config.mjs` - Removed `darkMode: 'class'` configuration. Removed all dark color variants (background.dark, foreground.dark, etc.).

## Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Font Loading Strategy** - Placed @font-face declarations in global.css imported via frontmatter (not `<style>` block) to ensure proper CSS cascade and font loading. Used .woff2 as primary format with .woff fallback for broad browser support.

2. **Font Weights** - Selected Light (300), Regular (400), Bold (700), and Black (900) weights. Initially used 400 for headings but upgraded to 900 based on design mockup comparison to match heavier typography.

3. **Dark Mode Removal** - Completely removed all dark mode infrastructure since design is light-only. This simplified CSS and reduced bundle size by removing unnecessary color variants and the theme toggle component.

4. **Nav Bar Active State Fix** - Used `!text-white` with Tailwind's `!important` flag to override global link color CSS that was making active nav text invisible. This was the minimal change needed while maintaining CSS hierarchy.

5. **Homepage Layout** - Increased bento grid from 480px to 620px max-width and "Shipped Products" text from 16px to 24px to better match design proportions and visual hierarchy.

## What Worked / Didn't Work

**Worked:**
- Font loading via frontmatter import immediately resolved @font-face issues
- Removing dark mode code was straightforward and cleaned up ~150+ lines of unnecessary styling
- Subagent approach was highly efficient for bulk changes (dark mode cleanup, homepage redesign, nav bar fix)
- PP Radio Grotesk fonts loaded successfully via public directory with proper MIME types
- Network requests confirmed font files were being served and loaded (200 status)

**Didn't Work / Issues Resolved:**
- Initially tried importing global.css in `<style>` block - @font-face wasn't loading. Fixed by moving import to frontmatter.
- Dark mode toggle remained visible on desktop after being "hidden" - fixed by explicitly targeting desktop breakpoint with `md:hidden`
- Active nav text was invisible due to global link color CSS overriding Tailwind classes - resolved by using `!important` flag

## Next Steps

1. **Review Typography** - Verify h1, h2, h3 sizing and weights across all pages match design specs
2. **Test Font Rendering** - Check font rendering quality on different browsers and devices
3. **Image Optimization** - Review bento grid image sizes and ensure they're properly optimized for web
4. **Cross-page Testing** - Navigate through all pages (Design, Contact, Thinking, project pages) to verify consistency
5. **Responsive Design** - Test mobile and tablet layouts to ensure they're responsive and match design
6. **Performance Audit** - Run lighthouse audit to check font loading performance and overall site performance
7. **Accessibility Check** - Verify color contrast ratios, WCAG compliance, and keyboard navigation work properly
