# Sarah's Portfolio - Session Log
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Time:** 15:14 (Session End)
**Status:** Phase 4 Complete + Figma Design Implementation ✅

---

## Session Overview

Continued work on Sarah's portfolio from Phase 3. Major accomplishment: **obtained Figma design file and implemented Sarah's actual visual design into the codebase** instead of using generic placeholder styling. Completed Phase 4 (reusable UI components) and did an additional design polish pass.

**Key Activities:**
1. Reviewed previous session progress (Phases 1-3 complete, foundations set)
2. Obtained Figma link from user and extracted exact design specifications
3. Built Phase 4 components (ProjectCard, Button, Card, ContactForm)
4. Implemented Sarah's Figma design: colors, typography, layout, navigation style
5. Debugged and fixed CSS/Tailwind color issues
6. Identified need for MCP debugging tools going forward

**Progress:** Now at ~30% complete with working homepage matching Sarah's design.

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. **Figma Extraction → Explicit Hex Colors**
- **Decision:** Moved from generic template colors to Sarah's exact specs (#3F3F3F, gradient background, etc.)
- **Rationale:** Ensures built site matches her actual design vision from day 1
- **Trade-off:** Had to abandon CSS custom properties due to Tailwind v4 compatibility issues

### 2. **Placeholder Font (Space Grotesk) for PP Radio Grotesk**
- **Decision:** Use Space Grotesk now, replace with PP Radio Grotesk once available
- **Rationale:** Both are geometric sans-serifs; similar visual weight. Unblocks development while Sarah sources the premium font
- **Implementation:** Added TODO comment with exact steps to swap fonts

### 3. **Light Mode Default**
- **Decision:** Changed from system preference detection to defaulting to light mode
- **Rationale:** Sarah's Figma design is light-themed; matches brand aesthetic
- **User Control:** Users can still manually toggle to dark mode

### 4. **Inline Styles as CSS Workaround**
- **Decision:** Added inline `style=` attributes to H1 and paragraphs
- **Rationale:** Tailwind v4 CSS variables weren't resolving in standard CSS rules; inline styles guarantee application
- **Limitation:** Not ideal for maintainability; should resolve root cause

### 5. **Split Layout Homepage**
- **Decision:** Implemented "text left, bento-box right" layout from Figma
- **Rationale:** Matches Sarah's design exactly; different from generic template approach
- **Placeholder Images:** Using CSS gradients/shapes for now; will swap for actual graphics

### 6. **Early MCP Setup Recommendation**
- **Decision:** Flagged Chrome DevTools MCP or Playwright as needed for next session
- **Rationale:** CSS debugging became challenging; visual inspection tools essential for frontend work

## What Worked / Didn't Work

### ✅ What Worked
1. **Figma Specification Extraction** - User shared Figma in Dev Mode; extracted exact colors, typography, spacing
2. **Phase 4 Components** - All 4 components built successfully with proper TypeScript, props, dark mode
3. **Subagent Workflow** - Using general-purpose subagents for multi-step tasks kept main conversation clean
4. **Inline Style Fix** - Resolved H1/paragraph visibility by using inline styles (quick workaround)
5. **Navigation Pill Design** - Successfully replicated Figma's pill-shaped nav with shadow and spacing
6. **Bento-Box Layout** - CSS grid implementation matches Figma aesthetic
7. **Demo Page Updates** - Showing components in action helped validate Phase 4 work

### ❌ What Didn't Work / Issues
1. **Tailwind v4 CSS Variables**
   - Custom properties defined in `@theme` not resolving in standard CSS rules
   - Example: `color: var(--color-foreground)` didn't work; had to use `color: #3F3F3F`
   - Affected headings, paragraphs, links

2. **Custom Tailwind Utility Classes**
   - Classes like `text-foreground` not generating in Tailwind v4
   - Had to switch to explicit hex colors: `text-[#3F3F3F]`
   - Indicates potential Tailwind config issue or v4 incompatibility

3. **Text Color Visibility**
   - Initially showed with wrong colors (disappearing on light/dark backgrounds)
   - Root cause: CSS variable resolution failures
   - Fixed by using explicit colors

4. **H1 Not Displaying**
   - Despite CSS rules, heading wasn't visible
   - Likely CSS specificity conflict with Tailwind utilities
   - Fixed with inline style attribute

### Lessons Learned
- Always verify CSS custom properties are working before committing to them
- Tailwind v4 CSS-based configuration (`@theme`) has compatibility quirks
- Inline styles are useful for debugging but indicate deeper CSS architecture issues
- User's visual feedback essential for frontend work (they caught text visibility issues immediately)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Set up MCP Debugging Tools**
   - Option A: Chrome DevTools MCP for inspecting live CSS
   - Option B: Playwright agent for automated visual testing
   - Will resolve CSS specificity issues properly

2. **Get PP Radio Grotesk Font**
   - User to obtain from Sarah
   - Integrate into project (swap Space Grotesk placeholder)
   - Follow TODO comment in global.css

3. **Refactor CSS Architecture**
   - Replace inline styles with proper CSS rules
   - Debug root cause of Tailwind v4 variable issues
   - Consider moving to simpler color system (not CSS variables)

### Phase 5: Actual Pages (Steps 21-23)
1. **Step 21:** Refine homepage with real content structure
2. **Step 22:** Create Design/Portfolio page with project grid
3. **Step 23:** Create Contact page with functional form

### Phase 6+: Content & Polish
1. Add actual project images/graphics from Sarah
2. Create project case study pages
3. Implement real project content (MDX files)
4. Dark mode visual refinement
5. Performance optimization
6. Accessibility audit
7. Testing across browsers

### Critical Path to Completion
- **By 1 week:** Complete Phases 5-6 (pages + content)
- **By 2 weeks:** Polish, animations, optimization
- **By 3 weeks:** Final QA, launch on Netlify

## Important Notes for Next Session

1. **Font Placeholder:** Space Grotesk is temp; need PP Radio Grotesk from Sarah
2. **CSS Issue:** Tailwind v4 custom properties not working as expected; may need config audit
3. **MCP Debugging:** Set up Chrome DevTools or Playwright ASAP for visual debugging
4. **Inline Styles:** Current homepage has inline styles as workaround; should refactor once CSS issues fixed
5. **Design Fidelity:** Homepage now matches Figma! Bento-box layout, colors, nav pill all correct
6. **Next Subagent Task:** Phase 5 (pages) can be spawned once fonts/debugging tools ready

---

**Session Status:** INCOMPLETE - User had to end session due to time constraints. Work was productive but CSS architecture needs attention. Ready to continue Phase 5 in next session.
