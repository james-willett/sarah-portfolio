# Session Log - 2026-01-16

## Session Overview
Fixed critical CSS and layout issues on Sarah's portfolio homepage. Resolved a CSS `@import` ordering error that was causing build warnings, and completely restructured the bento grid layout to match the design mockup with proper image sizing and positioning.

## File Changes
- **Modified:** `src/pages/index.astro`
  - Restructured bento grid from uniform 2x2 grid to asymmetric flexbox layout
  - Fixed text alignment to vertically center with images
  - Adjusted image sizes and spacing to match design proportions
  - Updated all responsive breakpoints (base, 1280px, tablet, mobile)

- **Modified:** `src/styles/global.css`
  - Moved Google Fonts `@import` to top of file (before Tailwind imports)
  - Fixed PostCSS warning: "@import must precede all other statements"

## Key Decisions & Rationale

**1. CSS Import Order Fix**
- Problem: Google Fonts `@import` was placed after Tailwind CSS import, resulting in line 1206
- Solution: Moved to top of file before any CSS rules
- Rationale: CSS spec requires `@import` statements before any other rules

**2. Layout Restructure: Grid → Flexbox**
- Problem: Uniform 2x2 grid didn't match design's asymmetric proportions
- Solution: Switched to flexbox with two rows (`bento-row-1` and `bento-row-2`)
- Rationale: Flexbox allows independent sizing/spacing per row, exact positioning needed for overlapping images

**3. Image Sizing & Overlaps**
- Hi-Gloss: 500px base, 580px on large screens (dominant element)
- IBM: 325px base, 380px on large screens (25% larger than original)
- Willett Way: 260px base, 300px on large screens
- Shipped Products: 220px base on large screens
- Negative margins used to create overlaps/tight spacing matching design

**4. Text Alignment**
- Changed grid from `items-start` to `items-center` for vertical centering
- Removed `lg:pt-8` padding that was pushing text down
- Reduced grid gap from 20px to 8px on large screens

## What Worked / Didn't Work

**What Worked:**
- Using `items-center` on the grid immediately fixed text alignment issue
- Negative margins on images (e.g., `-80px`, `-120px`, `-40px`) effectively created the overlapping/close layout
- Flexbox approach provided precise control over per-row positioning
- Using Astro's Image component width properties helped scale images responsively

**What Didn't Work (Initially):**
- First attempt with `object-fit: contain` kept images small despite large containers (images fit within, not filling)
- Uniform 2x2 CSS grid couldn't accommodate asymmetric design proportions
- Too much gap spacing between elements (initially 1.5rem, needed -80px negative margins)
- Media query overrides for large screens were being applied before base styles took effect

## Next Steps
1. Test responsive behavior at different screen sizes (tablet, mobile)
2. Verify image overlap behavior on smaller screens doesn't cause layout issues
3. Check accessibility (ensure hover states and link targets still work with overlaps)
4. Consider adding subtle animations/transitions for hover states on the image links
5. Test on actual device viewport sizes to ensure alignment matches design across all breakpoints
6. Review performance impact of larger image sizes on mobile
