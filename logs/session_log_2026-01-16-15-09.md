# Session Log: 2026-01-16 (15:09)

## Session Overview

Successfully completed Phase 5 (Static Pages) with all three static pages built and deployed:
- Design/Work page with project grid
- Thinking page (placeholder for external site)
- Contact page with form integration

Diagnosed and fixed critical color scheme issue affecting text readability across the site. Updated Tailwind config to match Sarah's Figma design specifications. Documented that the Thinking page will point to an external site and doesn't need further development in this project.

## File Changes

**Created:**
- `src/pages/design.astro` - Portfolio grid page fetching projects from content collection
- `src/pages/thinking.astro` - Placeholder page for external site link
- `src/pages/contact.astro` - Contact form page with social links
- `logs/` directory for session logging

**Modified:**
- `tailwind.config.mjs` - Fixed color definitions (foreground, muted, accent, border, background) to match Sarah's Figma specs (#3F3F3F primary text color)
- `astro.config.mjs` - Added TODO comment documenting Thinking page as external link placeholder
- `progress.txt` - Added THINKING PAGE DECISION notes and color fix documentation
- `TECHNICAL_PLAN.MD` - Updated site structure table to document Thinking page as placeholder
- `src/pages/thinking.astro` - Updated header comment documenting external site intention

## Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Thinking Page as External Link Placeholder**
   - Decision: Keep `/thinking` page as simple placeholder, document for future external URL swap
   - Rationale: Sarah's thinking/blog content will live on separate external site; no need to build it in this project. This avoids unnecessary work and keeps scope focused.
   - Documentation: Added clear TODOs in config, progress tracker, and technical plan

2. **Color Scheme Fix**
   - Decision: Updated Tailwind config to use exact Figma specifications (#3F3F3F)
   - Rationale: Previous config had wrong colors (#1A1A1A too dark), breaking readability. Tailwind classes were overriding global CSS.
   - Applied consistently: Updated foreground, muted, accent, border, and background colors to match Figma

3. **Used Playwright MCP for Visual Debugging**
   - Decision: Used Chrome DevTools MCP to verify color changes across all pages
   - Rationale: Real visual feedback faster than guessing; caught readability issues immediately
   - Approach: Tested all 4 pages (home, design, thinking, contact) to ensure consistency

## What Worked / Didn't Work

✅ **What Worked:**
- Sub-agent successfully completed Phase 5 pages on first attempt
- Color scheme issue diagnosed quickly using Playwright
- Clear, semantic approach to documenting design decisions
- All pages responsive and accessible from the start
- Build verification worked without errors

❌ **What Didn't Work Initially:**
- Tailwind config colors didn't match global CSS values (mismatch between two sources)
- Sub-agent built full Thinking page content (unnecessary since it's external)
  - Fix: Documented and won't repeat - now clear in codebase

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Phase 6: Dynamic Project Pages** - Build `src/pages/projects/[slug].astro`
   - Create dynamic routing for project detail pages
   - Use ProjectLayout component
   - Test with sample project data

2. **Phase 7: Sample Content** - Add test project files
   - Create sample MDX project files (HiGloss, IBM, Shipped Products)
   - Add placeholder images to `src/assets/projects/`
   - Verify projects appear on /design grid

### After That
3. **Phase 8: Styling & Responsiveness** - Polish all pages
   - Implement proper responsive breakpoints (320px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px)
   - Add hover states and transitions
   - Verify dark mode across all pages
   - Test on real devices

4. **Get Sarah's Design References** for:
   - Any page design improvements beyond current placeholder layouts
   - Project detail page layout preferences
   - Contact page styling (if different from current)

### Long-term Goals
- Phase 9: Performance optimization
- Phase 10: SEO & accessibility
- Phase 11: Deployment setup
- Phase 12: Documentation
- Phase 13-14: Final testing and handoff to Sarah

## Technical Notes

- Astro build completes successfully with no errors
- Color definitions now match across global.css and tailwind.config.mjs
- All pages support dark mode via `dark:` Tailwind variants
- Contact form ready for Netlify integration (pending deployment)
- ProjectCard component ready for project grid once content added

## Lessons Learned

1. Keep design specs and config in sync - single source of truth matters
2. Visual testing with Playwright MCP catches issues faster than theoretical review
3. Document decisions about scope (like external Thinking site) early to avoid wasted effort
4. Phase-based development keeps momentum clear and prevents scope creep
