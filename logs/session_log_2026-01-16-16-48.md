# Session Log: 2026-01-16

**Date:** January 16, 2026
**Time:** 16:48 UTC
**Focus:** Design Page Layout & Copy Fixes

---

## Session Overview

Fixed the Design page (`/design`) to match the target design screenshot. The page had incorrect copy in the header, wrong project titles, and misaligned content. All issues were resolved by updating the page template and project MDX frontmatter, plus styling adjustments to center-align text elements. No tags are now displayed on project cards on the Design page.

## Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Centralized Header Section**: Applied `text-center` to match the screenshot's centered layout while maintaining responsive design principles. Used Tailwind's `mx-auto` on paragraphs to ensure proper centering across breakpoints.

2. **Removed Tags from Design Page**: The screenshot showed no tags on cards, so we removed the `tags` prop from ProjectCard rendering on the design page specifically, rather than modifying the component. This preserves tag functionality elsewhere (homepage) while matching the target design.

3. **Project Title Shortening**: Reduced "IBM Design System" → "IBM" and "Shipped Products" → "Shipped" to match the target copy, which appears more concise and impactful on the design page.

4. **Delegated to Sub-Agent**: Used a general-purpose agent to handle all edits systematically, reducing context switching and ensuring all files were read before modification.

## What Worked / Didn't Work

### ✅ What Worked

- **Chrome DevTools Verification**: Used the Chrome DevTools MCP to verify changes visually and confirm the page matched the target screenshot
- **Systematic Approach**: Reading all project files first, then creating a comprehensive plan, prevented mistakes and made execution straightforward
- **Sub-Agent Delegation**: The general-purpose agent efficiently handled all five file modifications with proper context
- **Visual Confirmation**: Full-page screenshots and accessibility snapshots confirmed alignment, text centering, and copy updates all applied correctly

### ⚠️ Minor Issue

- Couldn't create `/logs` at root due to filesystem permissions, so created logs directory in the project instead (`Sarah-Portfolio/logs/`)

## Next Steps

1. **Commit Session Progress**: Commit the design page fixes and this session log to git
2. **Update progress.txt**: Mark design page completion in the project's progress tracker
3. **Review Remaining Phases**: Check TECHNICAL_PLAN.MD and progress.txt for next features to implement
4. **Consider Dark Mode Testing**: Verify the design page looks correct in dark mode with the new centered layouts
