## Session Overview

Successfully completed **Step 28.3: Update background gradient site-wide**. Retrieved exact gradient specifications from Sarah's Figma design file (node 1:772) and updated the site-wide background gradient. Key accomplishment: verified the gradient was correctly applied by comparing computed CSS styles, then created a dramatic version to visually demonstrate the gradient was working for James's confirmation.

## File Changes

**Modified:**
- `src/styles/global.css` - Updated body background gradient from 188deg (incorrect) to 90deg (correct per Figma), changed color stops from 5 simple hex colors to precise HSLA values matching Figma specs exactly
- `progress.txt` - Marked Step 28.3 as complete with detailed notes on gradient values and verification approach

**No files created or deleted.**

## Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Gradient Direction & Stops Changed**
   - Decision: Switch from 188deg vertical gradient to 90deg horizontal gradient with different color stop percentages
   - Rationale: Figma design specifies 90deg with stops at 0%, 11%, 23%, 35%, 100% (not evenly spaced). This provides subtle directional color shifts across the page
   - Evidence: Retrieved from Figma node 1:772 color palette documentation

2. **Verification Method**
   - Decision: Used Chrome DevTools to inspect computed CSS styles on body element
   - Rationale: The subtle gradient is nearly imperceptible to the eye (colors only vary by 3-10 RGB values), so programmatic verification was more reliable than visual inspection alone
   - Result: Confirmed RGB values matched HSLA values when converted: `rgb(242, 242, 242)` through `rgb(250, 250, 250)` across the 5 stops

3. **Dramatic Test Version for Confirmation**
   - Decision: Created exaggerated gradient (blue → pink → yellow) to show James the gradient was definitely working
   - Rationale: Subtle design can be hard to confirm visually; showing dramatic version proved mechanism works, then reverted to original
   - Outcome: James confirmed seeing the gradient clearly, then approved revert to subtle version

## What Worked / Didn't Work

✅ **What Worked:**
- Figma MCP server integration allowed direct access to design specs from node 1:772
- Computed CSS inspection method was reliable for verifying subtle gradient
- Dramatic gradient test was effective proof of concept
- Build verification confirmed no errors after changes
- Gradient applies consistently across all pages (Home, Design, Contact)

✅ **What Didn't Work Initially:**
- Visual inspection alone was insufficient to confirm the subtle gradient (it's nearly imperceptible)
- Screenshot comparison didn't provide confidence due to gradient subtlety
- Solution: Used computed CSS inspection + dramatic test version instead

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Step 28.4: Add floating project index (table of contents)**
   - Create sticky left-side navigation for project case study pages
   - Shows sections: Overview, Challenge, Research, Solution, Design Process, Outcome, Reflection
   - Implement smooth scroll to section on click
   - Test on project detail pages

2. **Steps 28.5-28.7: Remaining Phase 7.5 refinements**
   - Step 28.5: Fix spacing to match Figma specifications
   - Step 28.6: Fix "Hi I'm Sarah" text jump on page load
   - Step 28.7: Ensure consistent heading typography

### After Phase 7.5
3. **Phase 8: Styling & Responsiveness** (Steps 29-32)
   - Apply Tailwind styling consistently
   - Test responsive design at breakpoints: 320px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
   - Add transitions and hover states
   - Verify dark mode styling

4. **Replace placeholder SVG thumbnails**
   - Replace with actual project images when available

## Technical Notes

- Figma gradient uses HSLA color model with precise hue/saturation/lightness values (not hex)
- HSLA conversion to RGB: `hsla(0, 0%, 95%, 1)` = `rgb(242, 242, 242)`
- Gradient is fixed attachment, covers full viewport (min-height: 100vh)
- Browser computed styles show full CSS chain: `rgba(0,0,0,0) linear-gradient(...) repeat fixed 0% 0% / auto padding-box border-box`

## Lessons Learned

1. **Subtle design can be hard to verify visually** - For near-imperceptible changes, always use computed CSS inspection
2. **HSLA vs Hex colors** - Figma exports design in HSLA (hue/saturation/lightness/alpha) which is more precise than hex for designer intent
3. **Dramatic testing is valid confirmation** - When visual proof is unclear, exaggerating the effect proves the mechanism works
4. **Consistency verification** - Tested gradient on multiple pages (not just one) to ensure site-wide application
